[Zee](https://twitter.com/ChatterboxDev) shared a great tip on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChatterboxDev/status/1506299424712142864) if you are working with React and have the React DevTools extension installed.

You can use `$r` in the **Console** tool to reference the currently selected element in the React DevTools. This is a great way to quickly inspect the props and state of a component.
