If you want to know which element has the focus on the web page at any time, you can use a [live expression](./live-expressions.md) in the **Console** tool.

1. Open the **Console**.
1. Click the **Create live expression** button (it looks like an eye icon).
1. In the text box that appears, type `document.activeElement`.
1. Now click/tab around on the page and see the live expression update to reflect which element is currently focused.
