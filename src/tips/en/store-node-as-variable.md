If you want to use a DOM node from the page in the console:

* Right-click the node in the **Elements** (or **Inspector** in Firefox).
* Click on **Store as global variable** (or **Use in Console** in Firefox).

The **Console** opens up, pre-filled with a new variable name (something like `temp1`) which you can use to refer to the node any time you want.

Note that if you only want to refer to the currently selected node (and not create a new variable), you can also [use `$0` in the console](./get-current-element-in-console.md).
