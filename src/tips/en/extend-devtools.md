There's [a lot of tools](/tips/en/discover-all-tools) in DevTools already, probably more than you use. But in some cases, you may need very specific tools that aren't available by default.

Thankfully, DevTools can be extended with custom tools! You can either download extensions others have created to customize the DevTools UI, or even **create your own**.

For example, you can download the [React DevTools extension](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools-extensions#installation) for Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

All browsers have their own extension stores where you can find other DevTools extensions: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/safari/extensions/).

To go further, you can create your own extensions. Here are a few links to learn about developing your own extensions:
