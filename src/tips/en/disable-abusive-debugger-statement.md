title: Disable abusive debugger statements that prevent inspecting websites
tags: ["javascript", "debug", "browser:firefox", "browser:chrome", "browser:edge", "browser:safari"]

Some websites make it impossible to use DevTools by adding `debugger` statements in their code.

The statements don't do anything for normal users, but as soon as DevTools is opened, the JavaScript execution pauses, and this makes it impossible to debug or inspect the site as normal.

To disable the abusive `debugger` statement:

* Open the **Sources** tool (or **Debugger** tool in Firefox).
* Right-click in the line number gutter, right next to the `debugger` statement.
* Create a new **Conditional breakpoint**.
* Enter `false` as the condition for this breakpoint.
* Refresh the page.

Now, everytime this line of code is executed, the breakpoint will be ignored because the condition always returns `false`. And the page will run normally!
