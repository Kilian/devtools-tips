Have you ever been frustrated because you couldn't style a popup or tooltip that appeared on hover? If it uses JavaScript to get displayed, it's hard to style without modifying the code to make it stay visible.

1. Switch the **Sources**/**Debugger** panel.
1. Then hover the element in the page so the popup appears, and leave the mouse there.
1. Now press `F8` to pause the debugger.

That's it! The JS engine will pause and freeze the state of the page. You can now switch back to **Elements**/**Inspector** and style the popup content!
