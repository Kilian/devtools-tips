title: Capture node creation stack traces

Have you ever wanted to know what caused a specific DOM node or element to be created in the page?
When working on a site that uses a lot of JavaScript and especially when you don't know the codebase, this can be a life saver.

It turns out there is a way to do this automatically without having to set breakpoints in the code at all. It is a hidden experiment for now so you will need to first enable it in Chrome or Edge.

* Go through the following steps once to enable the experiment:
  * Go to the DevTools settings (press F1, or use the gear icon in the toolbar)
  * Go to the **Experiments** tab
  * Check the **Capture node creation stacks** box
  * Reload DevTools

* Make sure DevTools is opened when using the website so that stack traces get captured. When you want to know what created a node:
  * Select the node in the Elements panel
  * In the sidebar, select the **Stack Trace** panel (you might have to first click on the **More tabs** chevron `>>` to see the tab)
  * The stack of JavaScript calls that led to the node creation (if any) should be displayed.
