In [Debug popups that appear on hover using JS](./debug-js-hover.md) we described how to pause the debugger to inspect popups that appear on hover and disappear as soon as the cursor moves away.

Here's another way to do this by [Zain Zafar](https://twitter.com/mzainzafar90) which involves using the `debugger` statement in the **Console**. Pretty neat!
