If you prefer to use `console.log()` statements rather than the JavaScript debugger because you find it difficult to set breakpoints in DevTools (or you can't), then you can use the `debugger` statement in JavaScript.

* Where you normally add a `console.log()`, add a `debugger`, directly in the code
* Open DevTools on your page
* Trigger the action that will make your code run
* The Sources panel (or Debugger panel in Firefox) will automatically open up, and pause script execution at that line, giving you a chance to see what are the values of local variables, the callstack, etc.
