title: Simulate multiple devices that are kept in sync

Instead of [simulating devices one by one](./simulate-devices.md) and switching between them, Polypane supports testing on multiple simulated devices and viewports at the same time.

It lets you test different simulated devices, viewports and media query features (like light and dark mode) side-by-side while keeping all your interactions (like clicks, hovers and keyboard input) in sync across all devices. This means anything you do in one device happens in all of them.
