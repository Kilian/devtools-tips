All browser DevTools have a few built-in functions in the console to do things like [get the current element](./get-current-element-in-console.md), or [copy a string](./copy-from-console.md). But Safari exposes 2 nice built-in functions:

* `queryInstances`
* `queryHolders`

These two functions are really useful when your site starts using a lot of JavaScript objects. In some situations, it may become difficult to keep track of the dependencies between these objects, and memory leaks may start to appear, too.

If `app.TodoItem` is a JavaScript class in your application, then `queryInstances(app.TodoItem)` will return an array of all of its instances.

Or if you want to know what refers to the object you're debugging, use `queryHolders(this)`, which will return an array of all the other objects that have references to `this`.
