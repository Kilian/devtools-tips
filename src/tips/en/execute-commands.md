There is a command menu in Edge and Chrome that allows you to quickly access many different features of DevTools without having to navigate the UI.

Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on mac) to open the command menu, and just start typing.

You can use this to, for example, switch to a different panel by typing its name, change the color theme, change settings, disable javascript, etc.
