You can easily copy an element's [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) expression from DevTools. This is useful if you need this expression for an automated test for example.

* Go to the Elements (or Inspector) panel
* Use the context-menu (right-click) on the element you care about
* Go into the Copy sub-menu
* Choose the Xpath option

Note that you can then use this xpath expression to [find elements again in DevTools](/tips/en/evaluate-xpath/).
