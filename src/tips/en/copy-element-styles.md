You can extract all the styles of an element in one go by using the **Copy styles** feature.

No need to go through all CSS rules and properties that apply to the element in the **Styles** pane, and manually build the resulting list. With this feature, you can get the whole list at once, with all of the needed styles:

1. Select the element you want to extract the styles from by right-clicking on it and choosing **Inspect**.
1. In the **Elements** tool, right-click the selected element.
1. Click **Copy** > **Copy styles**.
1. Paste the result in a text editor and use however you want.
