DevTools supports 2 ways to evaluate [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) expressions to help you locate elements in the page. All browsers support those 2 ways:

* From the Elements (or Inspector) panel:
  * Click anywhere in the panel to make sure it has focus
  * Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> on Mac) to focus the search field
  * Enter your XPath expression and press enter to find the elements that match

Note that you can also [copy the XPath expression from any element in DevTools](/tips/en/copy-element-xpath/).

* From the Console panel:
  * You can use the built-in `$x()` helper function like this:

```javascript
$x('//div/div/label');
```
