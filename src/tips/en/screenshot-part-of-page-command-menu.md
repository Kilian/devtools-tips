The [Command menu](./execute-commands.md) in Edge and Chrome is a great way to do many of the things you can do in DevTools without having to navigate the UI.

[Csaba Kissi](https://twitter.com/csaba_kissi) shared a great tip on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/csaba_kissi/status/1506904947631304708) about the Command menu:

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> on Windows or Linux (or <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> on mac) to open the Command menu in DevTools.
1. Type "screenshot" to filter the list of commands.
1. Select the screenshot command you want to use, such as **Capture area screenshot** to grab a screenshot of a part of the page.
