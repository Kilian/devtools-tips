CSS transforms can sometimes be hard to wrap your head around, especially when chaining multiple transformations.

Firefox helps with a cool visualization tool that allows you to see how and where the element was before being transformed, **and** how it is now.

Being able to compare the 2 states at the same time makes it easier to debug your `transform` CSS properties.

* Select the transformed element in the **Inspector**.
* Find the `transform` property in the **Rules** sidebar panel.
* Hover over the property value.
* The on-page highlighter appears.
