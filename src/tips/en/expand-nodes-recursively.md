You can expand all descendants under a given DOM node in one go, to avoid having to expand each node one by one, which may take a while.

* In Chrome and Edge
  * Right-click on the node you want to expand and select "Expand recursively". You can also `alt+click` or `option+click` on the arrow next to the node.
* In Firefox and Safari
  * Right-click on the node you want to expand and select "Expand All". You can also `alt+click` or `option+click` on the arrow next to the node.
