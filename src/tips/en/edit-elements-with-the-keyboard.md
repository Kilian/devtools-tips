title: Edit an element's attributes and tag name with the keyboard
tags: ["tip", "html", "productivity", "browser:chrome", "browser:edge", "browser:firefox", "browser:safari"]

Using the keyboard can be faster than using a mouse in certain cases (and for some people). One such case is editing an element's tag name and attributes in DevTools.

To do this, select an element in the **Elements** tool (called **Inspector** in Firefox) and:

* Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to start the editing mode. The first attribute of the element becomes editable with the keyboard! (Note: on Firefox, the tag name becomes editable first).
* After you have made the necessary changes, you can:
  * Either press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again to commit the change.
  * Or, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move to the next or previous attribute, or the tag name if there are no other attributes.
