Taking a photo of a mobile device or tablet is daunting as you have to deal with fingerprints, glare and focus issues. Using Device Emulation makes this a lot easier.

To take a screenshot of a web page inside a device frame, use either Chrome or Edge (or any Chromium browser):

* In DevTools, turn on **Device Emulation** by clicking the icon or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Mac).
* Select a device from the Device dropdown menu. Be aware that not all devices have graphical frames.

* Click the **…** button (**More options**) and select **Show device frame**.

* Click the **…** button again and select **Capture screenshot**.

That's it, you now have a photo of your web page inside a device on transparent background.

You can see this in action in the following video:
