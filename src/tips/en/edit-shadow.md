If you don't remember the CSS syntax for the `box-shadow` property (and who does!), then Chrome and Edge can help you with their visual shadow editor!

* Select an element that has some shadow applied.
* Go to the **Styles** pane.
* Click on the little shadow editor icon next to the `box-shadow` property value.
